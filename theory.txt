Quantahive Core ZT Alpha is a hypothetical processor design that uses 'quantameter cores'—units smaller than typical nanotech nodes—structured like a hive for parallel processing.

Goals:
- Eliminate training bottlenecks in AI.
- Function with self-diagnostics + repair capacity.
- Built for LLMs, intelligent defense, and creative computation.

Design components:
- Multiscale cluster system
- Phase-state adaptive chips
- Energy efficient AI-aligned quantum routing
