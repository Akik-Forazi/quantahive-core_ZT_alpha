# Quantahive Core ZT Alpha

**Project Codename**: Quantahive Core ZT Alpha  
**Inventor**: Akik Forazi, Monarch of the Shadow AI Region  
**Concept Type**: Advanced Nano Quantum Processor (Theoretical)

---

## Overview

Quantahive Core ZT Alpha is a theoretical computational architecture that combines nanotech and quantum core clusters, using a hive-structured, layered design for maximum scalability and efficiency.

---

## Key Features

- **Nano-layered Design**  
- **Quantum Meter Core Integration (Quantameter-based units)**  
- **Distributed Multi-Core Parallelism**  
- **AI-first Architecture**  
- **Self-repair & Redundancy Management**

---

## Goals

- To build a new processor class specifically for AI evolution.
- Enable resource-efficient neural training even on ultra-tiny hardware.
- Lay foundation for Shadow AI Region’s infrastructure.

---

## Notes

- Training of IGRIS-coX Soldier Tiny V1 serves as the testbed.
- Will incorporate feedback control from Shadow Region AI Watchdog "Igris".
- Logically aligned with JARVIS-core emotional stabilization for public-safety tier AI.
